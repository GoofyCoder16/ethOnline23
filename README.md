# AnonYSurf
### Leveraging web2 Social with Anonymous Authentication and Verification

##### Users can effortlessly add their videos, benefitting from off-chain verification powered by the UMA protocol which let users assert that they own a certain Video Link. There is a time period when anyone can challenge these assertions and prevent this.But here's the twist - to watch these videos, users must meet specific criteria, whether they're on-chain or off-chain. Whether it's holding a particular token or NFTs, demonstrating GitHub contributions, or being a member of a DAO, we make it possible through our SismoConnectApp.We're solving critical issues such as private web2 streaming, all based on On-chain or Off-chain data. No more false comments on videos, as only experienced individuals are allowed to view and comment.
##### AnonYSurf leverages the latest technology like Next.js for a dynamic frontend, Moralis-Web3UiKit for a smooth user experience, and Js for Chrome extension. This, combined with UMA protocol and Sismo, ensures a seamless and secure experience for all without revealing and sharing  any private data of user.

## Problems Faced-
1. UMA OptimisticOracleV3 .sol is not deployed at many blockchains including Mantle and Scroll , so AnonYSurf cant be deployed at Mantle and Scroll.
2. I have tried to implement PloygonID but came to relaize that iden3/contracts have some wrong commits of renaming a  function whuch has not done to all contracts yet that make it nearly impossible to integrate it.
3. It was challenging to use chrome extension with web3 stuff.
